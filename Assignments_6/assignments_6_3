#3. Write a program which contains one class named as Arithmetic.Arithmetic class contains three instance variables as Value1 ,Value2.
#Inside init method initialise all instance variables to 0.There are three instance methods inside class as Accept(), Addition(), Subtraction(),
#Multiplication(), Division().Accept method will accept value of Value1 and Value2 from user.
#Addition() method will perform addition of Value1 ,Value2 and return result.Subtraction() method will perform subtraction of Value1 ,Value2 and return result.
#Multiplication() method will perform multiplication of Value1 ,Value2 and return result.Division() method will perform division of Value1 ,Value2 and return result.
#After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
