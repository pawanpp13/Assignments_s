#Write a program which contains one class named as Circle.Circle class contains three instance variables as Radius ,Area, Circumference.
#That class contains one class variable as PI which is initialise to 3.14.Inside init method initialise all instance variables to 0.0.
#There are three instance methods inside class as Accept(), CalculateArea(),CalculateCircumference(), Display().
#Accept method will accept value of Radius from user.CalculateArea() method will calculate area of circle and store it into instance variable Area.
#CalculateCircumference() method will calculate circumference of circle and store it into instancevariable Circumference.
#And Display() method will display value of all the instance variables as Radius , Area,Circumference.
#After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
