#5)Design python application which contains two threads named as thread1 and thread2.Thread1 display 1 to 50 on screen and thread2 display 50 to 1 in reverse order on
#screen. After execution of thread1 gets completed then schedule thread2.

def Thread1():
    for i in range(1,51):
        print(i)

def Thread2():
    for i in range(50,-1,-1):
        print(i)
    

def main():
    val1 = threading.Thread(target=Thread1, args=())
    val2 = threading.Thread(target=Thread2, args=())
    
    val1.start()
    val1.join()
    val2.start()
    
if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
