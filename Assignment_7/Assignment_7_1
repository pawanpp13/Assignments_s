#1.Write a program which contains one class named as BookStore.BookStore class contains two instance variables as Name ,Author.

#books.Initialise instance variable in init method by accepting the values from user as name and author.Inside init method increment value of NoOfBooks by one.

#After creating the class create the two objects of BookStore class as
#Obj1 = BookStore(“Linux System Programming”, “Robert Love”)
#Obj1.Display() # Linux System Programming by Robert Love. No of books : 1

#Obj2 = BookStore(“C Programming”, “Dennis Ritchie”)
#Obj2.Display() # C Programming by Dennis Ritchie. No of books : 2
